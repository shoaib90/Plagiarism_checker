The Dalits regularly indulge themselves in jobs such as scavenging, cleaning public and residential places, tackling dead cattle corpses etc. This clearly states that they were an important part of the society as they worked to keep it clean and healthy for everyone. Rather the jobs they did were one of the prime reasons of the inhuman treatment they received. They were denied basic rights such as using public places, entering temples, using schools, wells, etc.
