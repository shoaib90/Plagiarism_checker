A summer camp is an essential part of school life. It is an event organized in the holidays and aimed at teaching various new skills to students in order to promote a learning environment and to equip them with real world skills, apart from the set academic learning. The progress of a student in these camps on various activities is closely monitored by counsellors and expert teachers present there. There are various kinds of summer camps. Some involve overnight stay where kids learn to look after themselves in the absence of their parents. Other one operates in day time where children are taught various new and important skills.
