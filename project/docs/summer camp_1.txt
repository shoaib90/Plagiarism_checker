A summer camp is not about sitting in an area bounded by four walls and staring at a teacher continuously speaking his mind instead it involves extensive learning and self development of the child. In addition to the various activities such as painting, swimming, dancing, playing instrument, etc that are usually taught at a summer camp, a child learns various valuable life skills such as leadership qualities, socialising with other kids and discipline which are as much important as academic knowledge. These skills build confidence in a child from the start and that in turn aids in his overall development.
