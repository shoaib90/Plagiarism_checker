Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a campaign launched by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi as a nationwide cleanliness campaign. It is implemented to fulfill the vision and mission of clean India one day. It was launched especially on the birth anniversary of the Mahatma Gandhi as he always dreamed and was very keen to make this country a clean country. He had tried for clean India during his time by motivating people through his campaigns and slogans however it was only partially successful because of the limited involvement of the people of India.
