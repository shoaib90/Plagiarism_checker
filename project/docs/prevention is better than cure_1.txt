It is good to go to the doctor when we get sick but it is very good when we don’t need to go to the doctor all around the year. Being healthy is much better than falling sick which is only possible when we follow prevention methods and be safe. It is very necessary for us to take all the precautionary and preventive measures in advance and avoid silly mistakes. We should take precautions during the change of every season so that we may not fall sick. Being indifferent or negligent to our health may definitely cause illness which may end to the costly cure and perhaps, sometimes impossible to get normal health.
