In India, the Dalits are usually victims of this system. People in our country are bifurcated based on their caste – The Brahmans, the Kshtriyas, the Vaishyas and the Shudras. The Shudras’s are the victims of untouchability. One of the reasons for outcasting them is that they indulge in labor and cleaning work. In addition to this, people indulging in specific jobs, tribal people and ones suffering from certain infections and diseases are considered as untouchables. They are not considered as an essential part of the society rather they were loathed and denied their share of respect and dignity.
