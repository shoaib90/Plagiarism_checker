The greenery, scenic beauty and the fresh air of village gives such a soothing effect. During my stay at village, I love exploring different places with my siblings. We play several games, swing on the roots of the banyan trees and walk by the riverside to get wet and play in the water. We also go for field trip with my maternal uncle and ride horses. The life in village is full of fun and activities. It never gets boring and I realize that I never watch TV or play games on the cell phones when in village. The days I spend in the village are always the most memorable days of my life.
