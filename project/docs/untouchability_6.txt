In spite of the extreme struggles of the leaders of independent India to abolish untouchability and the caste system, it still prevails in modern India in different forms than those in the past. The formulation of laws against its practice has to some extent reduced the frequency and intensity of such discrimination and treatment. Since Independence, the government has started many campaigns for the people of backward class such as providing free education, reservation in colleges and government jobs etc. This is a hope for all the liberals and Dalits out there and a promise for a new, better and tolerant India.
