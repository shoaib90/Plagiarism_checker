He is the real father of our nation who really used his all power to make us free from the British rule. He truly understood the power of unity in people (from different castes, religions, community, race, age or gender) which he used all through his independence movement. Finally he forced Britishers to quit India forever through his mass movements on 15th of August in 1947. Since 1947, the 15th of August is celebrated every year as the Independence Day in India.
