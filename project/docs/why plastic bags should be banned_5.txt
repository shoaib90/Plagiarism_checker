The increasing use of plastic is increasing the amount of plastic waste which is hard to dispose of. Plastic is a non-biodegradable substance. It breaks into pieces, deteriorates over the time but does not become one with the soil. It remains in the environment for hundreds of years and adds to environmental pollution. It goes into the landfills and leaks pollutants that damage soil and water. Plastic cannot even be disposed of by burning as on burning it produces poisonous gases that can cause serious diseases. Disposing plastic has thus become a big challenge today.
