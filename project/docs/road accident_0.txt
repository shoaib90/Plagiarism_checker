Maximum people including me, believe in luck or fate but the problem is that, when something goes wrong, we blame it on fate, rather than accepting our fault. For example, if a meteor falls on one’s house and destroys it. It can be said that it’s bad luck because there was no way by which the person could have guessed its coming or could have done anything  to protect his/her house but if you are going on your bike and due to some reason, your bike slips and you get a serious head injury. Is it luck? I am afraid it’s not, It’s gross negligence. If you would have worn your helmet, the head injury would have been avoided.
