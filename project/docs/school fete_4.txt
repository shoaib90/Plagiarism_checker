Now, with so many pre-primary schools around it is hard to drill down to one. The competition is high and this is one of the reasons these schools focus so much on carnivals. They send invites almost everywhere. Pamphlets are distributed and hoardings are installed to promote these events. These carnivals have become a way to lure parents. Special stalls are set up to boast about the pros of the school in an attempt to enroll more and more students.
