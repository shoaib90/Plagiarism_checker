I am super excited as I will visit my grandparents in the village Dharagiri, 5 km away from Navsari, with my family this summer vacation. I feel very eager and happy to visit my native place since I get a chance to meet my grandparents, other relatives and cousins. My grandparent’s house in the village is surrounded with the trees of mango, coconut, chikoo, guava, pomegranate and several other fruits and vegetables. I love plucking fresh fruits and enjoy eating them. I am especially fond of mangoes. My maternal aunt cooks delicious traditional recipes for us. The taste and aroma of the food is amazing and we enjoy it with delight.
