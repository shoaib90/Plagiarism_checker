According to a credible research, most of the road accidents could be avoided or their effect could be minimised if proper precautions are taken. The issue is that maximum people are aware of the safety precautions and also traffic rules and regulations but they consider it (especially youngsters) cool to not to follow them. How this trend started and gained momentum can be a matter of debate but the fact is this problem has taken monstrous proportions and if something is not done urgently, then very soon things will go out of control.
