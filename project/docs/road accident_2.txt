I think no amount of rules and regulations can solve this problem. For this the mentality of the public (especially youngsters) needs to be changed. I think, this could be done by creating awareness among public through various awareness programs. Let’s hope that in the coming time better sense will prevail among the public and the number of deaths caused by the road accidents will come down.
